# Hardware vs Software

## Hardware

Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. These are the parts you can physically touch and see, such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, motherboard, hard drive, memory modules, and so on. Hardware also includes internal components like the CPU (Central Processing Unit), and external devices like printers and scanners.

## Software

Software, on the other hand, refers to the programs, procedures, and routines that control and manage the operation of the hardware and direct its operation. Software cannot be physically touched. It includes applications (like Microsoft Office, web browsers, and games), operating systems.

# Types of Software

Software can be broadly divided into three categories:

## System Software

System software is designed to manage and control the operations of a computer system. It serves as the interface between the user, the hardware, and the other software on the system. Examples of system software include operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, device drivers, servers, utilities, and operating systems.

## Application Software

Application software, also known as an "application" or an "app", is software designed to help users perform specific tasks. Examples include word processors like Microsoft Word, spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, web browsers like Google Chrome, and graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop.

## Programming Software

Programming software is a set of tools to assist developers in writing programs. The various tools include text editors, compilers, interpreters, linkers, debuggers, etc. Programming software is also known as programming tool or software development tool. Examples include Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and PyCharm.
